I wrote this post as a reminder to myself that [using const enums in a library
is a really bad idea][enum-problem-in-library].

So in short. If you are writing a library and you export a `const enum` then
some developers will not be able to compile their applications if they import
your library. Especially when using Babel. Here we look at why.

## Enums: handle with care

When you declare an `enum`, Typescript will generate some code for it. This is
fine if you are writing an application code and you do not care what is
generated. But when you are writing a library you sometimes do not need the
features provided by this style of declarations - you just want to use enums
instead of constants.

This has a solution - you can use `const enum` instead of an `enum`. Typescript
does not generate code for `const enum` declaration. This is great - it is just
like using constant - but there is a problem.

### Isolated modules

When you are writing a library you do not have control over your code and how is
used or compiled. Nor what compiler is used and how. Especially Babel and other
transpilers operate over one file at a time. That means that the type
information are stripped and a code transformation that depends on understanding
the full type system cannot be applied. Simply `const enum` imported to another
file is gone.

To prevent this error in libraries you should use `--isolatedModules` option in
your `tsconfig.json` file.

  documentation][tsconfig-isolated-modules] or in the article [Typescript: Don't
  export const enums][dont-export-const-enums].

## Prefer union types over enums

`enum` and `const enum` are features from "the old days" of the Typescript where
the Javascript landscape was a lot different. In addition, enums generate a lot
of code you probably do not want. And also numeric enums are not type-safe. And
instead of key-value-based enums you can use an object which will serve the
same.

```typescript
const Direction = {
  Up: 0,
  Down: 1,
  Left: 2,
  Right: 3,
} as const;

// Get to the const values of any object
type Values<T> = T[keyof T];

// Values<typeof Direction> yields 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
declare function move(direction: Values<typeof Direction>): void;

move(30);
//   ^ üí• This breaks!

move(0);
//   ^ üëç This works!

move(Direction.Left);
//   ^ üëç This also works!

// And now for the Status enum

const Status = {
  Admin: 'Admin',
  User: 'User',
  Moderator: 'Moderator',
} as const;

// Values<typeof Status> yields "Admin" | "User" | "Moderator"
declare function closeThread(
  threadId: number,
  status: Values<typeof Status>,
): void;

closeThread(10, 'Admin'); // All good!
closeThread(10, Status.User); // enum style
```

A better approach is to use union types. A simple union type gives you something
that works similary and is much more aligned with Typescript.

```typescript
type Status = 'Admin' | 'User' | 'Moderator';

declare function closeThread(threadId: number, status: Status): void;

closeThread(10, 'Admin');
// All good :-)
```

  Enum][tidy-typescript-avoid-enums].

## Conclusion

- use `enum` or `const enum` in application code
- set `--isolatedModules` in `tsconfig.json` to `true` in libraries
- prefer value object if you want a key-value based enum
- prefer union types generally over enums
