Once upon a time, I was solving the problem of how to transform keys in a JavaScript object to the new names.
I thought that there must be some kind of map or one from the trinity of `filter`, `map` and `reduce` must be used.

But every time I am solving this kind of problem I am asking the question if I am not reinventing the wheel.
This must be a common problem and there must be anyone before me who solved this problem.

And Yes, it was solved before me.

```js
const mapKeys = (obj, fn) =>
  Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, k) => {
    acc[fn(obj[k], k, obj)] = obj[k];
    return acc;
  }, {});

mapKeys({ a: 1, b: 2 }, (val, key) => key + val); // { a1: 1, b2: 2 }
```

The solution came from the post [Transform the keys of a JavaScript object][transform-object-keys] on the [30 seconds of code][30secondsofcode] site.

It is a great site. There can be found code snippets not only for Javascript but for CSS, React promiseHooks, Git and Node.js as well.
