  'How to setup Gatsby to highlight syntax of code examples in your posts'
---

Running a developer's blog means that you want to also show a lot of code
examples in your posts. And you also want the code to be read as easily as is in
your code editor. That means using some kind of syntax highlighting.

If you are a user of VSCode like me, you probably want to highlight your code
the same way as is in your editor. It can be done in a very easy way.

## Find and install the right theme

Just find your favorite VSCode theme on GitHub and check if there are predefined
themes in JSON like in
[vsc-community-material-theme](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-community-material-theme/tree/develop/themes).
If so, just install it to your project.

```sh
npm install https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-community-material-theme

// or

yarn add https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-community-material-theme
```

Then your `package.json` should look like this:

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
    "vsc-community-material-theme": "https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-community-material-theme"
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Configure Gatsby

In the next step you must configure your Gatsby site to use this theme. But how?

Since [Visual Studio Code][vscode] is built with web technology and has
incredible syntax highlighting capabilities, [Andrew Branch][branch-blog]
decided to make the syntax highlighting of VSCode available for gatsby sites
with his library [gatsby-remark-vscode][gatsby-remark-vscode].

This allows you to use VSCode extensions like syntax highlighting themes or
language definitions and get the same syntax highlighting in your Gatsby site
that you would otherwise have in your editor.

That is what I am currently using on this blog. And it has also many amazing
features like:

- [line number toggle, highlighting of specific lines](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#line-numbers)
  - ` ```js {numberLines}`
- [diff highlighting to highlight changes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#diff-highlighting)
  - ` ```js {diff}` and `+` and `-` on lines
- [highlighting of a specific line of code](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#line-highlighting)
  - ` ```js{1,3-5}`
- [switch between dark & light mode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#multi-theme-support),
  [change when specific media queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#reacting-to-other-media-queries)
  or parent selectors are matched (e.g. high contrast mode)
- [highlighting inline code with an inline code marker](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-vscode/#inline-code-highlighting)
  and then using that code marker by writing something like
  <code>&grave;js»const answer = 42&grave;</code> to get highlighted inline code
  like `js»const answer = 42`.

To do so you must go to `gatsby-config.js` and extends the configuration you use
with `gatsbyRemarkVSCode.remarkPlugin` and pass it some options. `theme` is the
most important option and it determines which theme will be used. It matches
with the file name in the `themes` directory of the installed repository. To
switch themes just use a different file name.

My current options for `gatsby-remark-vscode` in `gatsby-config.js` look like
this:

```js
// /gatsby-config.js

const gatsbyRemarkVSCode = require('gatsby-remark-vscode');
// ...
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
      options: {
        remarkPlugins: [
          [
            gatsbyRemarkVSCode.remarkPlugin,
            {
              theme: `Community-Material-Theme-Default-High-Contrast`,
              extensions: ['vsc-community-material-theme'],
              inlineCode: {
                marker: '»',
              },
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Syntax highlighting in MDX

Syntax highlighting is then applied to the `pre` HTML tag.

If you are using MDX just like me, you can even modify this `pre` tag with a
custom component. For me it is `<Pre />` component with additional styling using
`styled-components`.

```jsx
// src/components/mdx/index.tsx

export default {
  pre: Pre,
  code: (props) => <Code {...props} />,
  inlineCode: (props) => <InlineCode {...props} />,
};

// src/components/mdx/Pre.tsx

import styled from 'styled-components';

const Pre = styled.pre`
  margin-top: calc(2 * (1.68 * (10px + 0.2vw) + 0.2vw));
  margin-bottom: calc(2 * (1.68 * (10px + 0.2vw) + 0.2vw));
  margin-right: calc(-1 * ((100vw - 100%) / 2));
  margin-left: calc(-1 * ((100vw - 100%) / 2));
  padding: calc(1 * (1.68 * (18px + 0.2vw) + 0.2vw)) 0;
  font-size: 0.85em;
  font-family: 'Fira Code', Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;

  @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    clip-path: polygon(0 5%, 100% 0, 100% 95%, 0% 100%);
  }
`;

export default Pre;
```

## Display language attribute

If you want to display a language of code in your code block, you can use the
`data-language` attribute to do so.

```jsx
// src/components/mdx/Pre.tsx

  :after {
    content: attr(data-language);
    opacity: 0.7;
    display: inline-block;
    transform: translate(-16px, 24px);
    text-align: right;
    width: 60%;
    margin-left: 20%;
    margin-right: 20%;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
```

## CSS-in-JS support

Amongst all of this goodness, the feature that I like best is that you can use
any VSCode extension that makes changes to the syntax highlighting. To have nice
CSS-in-JS syntax highlighting in VSCode, I use an extension called
[vscode-styled-components][vscode-styled-components].

To set this up you must add that extension to the Gatsby project and then
configure gatsby-remark-vscode to use it. You have to install it directly from
GitHub because it's not published as an NPM package.

## Conclusion

If you run a developer blog like me, it is a good idea to use syntax
highlighting in your code blocks. Use libraries that are designed for this use
case and make sure that you use them in the right way.
