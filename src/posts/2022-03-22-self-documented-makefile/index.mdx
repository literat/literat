I was always struggling with how to orchestrate projects which consist of multiple technologies in one stack. For example,
if you have a web application that is written in PHP using Symfony or Laravel framework for the backend and React for
the frontend. Also, have a database and cache and all of that is running in docker.

There are plenty of tasks you must do to have your project up and running:

- bring the docker image up
- exec composer install in the running container
- exec npm install in the running container
- build frontend
- migrate database
- and so on...

For all these tasks you are using different commands and different task runners.

There is a `composer` for PHP, `npm/yarn/pnpm` for frontend, `docker-compose` for containers, `bin/console` for Symfony or
`artisan` for Laravel and, maybe some other shell/bash scripts you need to run. Different runners, different APIs. How is
even able to remember all those commands and scripts?

And here comes Makefile handy.

## Single source of project scripts

`make` is one of the oldest CLI task launchers, has plenty of documentation, is extremely powerful, and is installed
everywhere. So, it can even replace language-specific task launchers (like npm or php bin/console) that
provide inline help, but that requires installation.

At [LMC][lmc] we are using Makefiles and `make` to orchestrate our Symfony and Node projects.

They usually look like this:

```makefile
host_type := $(shell uname -s)
architecture := $(shell uname -m)

build_base := docker-compose --env-file ./local_hosts.env -f docker-compose.yml

# architecture stuff
# ...

build:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c " \
  npm ci \
  && (cd app/Resources/assets/ui/docs && npm ci) \
  && composer install \
  && composer install --working-dir=selenium-tests \
  && npm run build \
  && bin/multidomain-console utility:cache:warmup \
  && chown -R www-data var \
  && ./doctrine-clear-cache.sh"

sync-start:
ifeq (Darwin, $(host_type))
  docker volume create --name=app-sync \
  && docker volume create --name=src-sync \
  && docker-sync start -c $(sync_config)
endif

# sync stuff
# ...

dev-start:
  make local-hosts-set \
  && make sync-start \
  && $(build_string) up -d $(force_recreate_param)

dev-stop:
  $(build_string) stop \
  && make sync-stop

# local dev stuff
# ...

npm-dev:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "npm run build:dev"

npm-dev-admin:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "npm run build:dev:admin"

npm-build:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "npm run build"

# npm stuff
# ...

# cleaning stuff
# ...

database-drop:
  $(build_string) rm -s -f dbseduo dbmongo
database-fixture:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c " \
  bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --append \
  && ./doctrine-clear-cache.sh"

migrations-migrate:
  docker-compose -f ./migrations/docker-compose.yml up

# database migration stuff
# ...

run:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "bin/console $(filter-out $@,$(MAKECMDGOALS))"

composer-validate:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer validate --no-check-all --strict"
composer-lock:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer update --lock"
composer:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "php -d memory_limit=-1 \
                  /usr/local/bin/composer $(filter-out $@,$(MAKECMDGOALS))"

# selenium tests
# ...

diff-analyzer:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer diff-analyzer"

rector-process:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer rector-process"
rector-dry:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer rector-dry"

test:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer test"

# code linting stuff
# ...

translation-upload:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer translation:upload"

# translations stuff
# ...

# js-expose
# ...

dbg-console:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "bash"
dbg-apache-console:
  $(build_string) exec apache sh -c "bash"

gql-generate:
  $(build_string) exec php sh -c "composer graphql"

ifeq (Darwin, $(host_type))
certificates-import:
  ./docker/nginx-proxy/certs/conf/import_into_mac.sh
endif
certificates-renew:
  ./docker/nginx-proxy/certs/conf/renew_certificates.sh -y

# catch all target (%) which does nothing to silently ignore the other goals.
%:
  @true
```

That is a hell of the commands, isn't that? How do you learn them all? How do you expose them without opening `Makefile`?

Maybe write them into a `README.md`? So with every new command, you must also update `README.md`, right?

Ours `README.md` was looking like this:

![readme](./readme.png 'README.md with listed commands')

What about documenting those commands using comments and exposing them?

## Self-documenting

Adding comments to the `Makefile` commands helps a lot to document them.

```makefile
## --- ðŸš€ Release management ----------------------------------------------------

.PHONY: release
release: ## create a new release
  @bin/make/release.sh
```

See? Much better, though.

But we can also use them and show them to the user in CLI. The way is simple. Just parse the `Makefile` using
regular expressions voodoo and add new `help` command with the script.

```makefile
## --- ðŸ’» Makefile ----------------------------------------------------------

.PHONY: help
help: ## print this help message
  @grep -E '(^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:.*?##.*$$)|(^##)' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) \
  | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}{printf "\033[32m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}' \
  | sed -e 's/\[32m##/[33m/'
```

Using `grep`, `awk` and `sed` you can achieve outstanding experience in your CLI.

**Tip**

- If you copy this code snippet to a makefile, make sure your text editor converts indentation to tabs and not spaces.

**Tip**

- Adjust the width of the first column by changing the 30 value in the `printf` pattern to something larger or smaller.

**Tip**

- Add the `| sort` to have targets ordered alphabetically instead of the way they appear in `Makefile`.

**Tip**

- Use [`.PHONY`][phony-target] target to avoid conflicts with other targets or files. This will help you to run the recipe regardless
  of whether there is a file of the same name.

**Tip**

- You can use positional arguments `make run foo bar baz`

```makefile
# If the first argument is "run"...
ifeq (run,$(firstword $(MAKECMDGOALS)))
  # use the rest as arguments for "run"
  RUN_ARGS := $(wordlist 2,$(words $(MAKECMDGOALS)),$(MAKECMDGOALS))
  # ...and turn them into do-nothing targets
  $(eval $(RUN_ARGS):;@:)
endif

prog: # ...
    # ...

.PHONY: run
run : prog
    @echo prog $(RUN_ARGS)
```

**Tip**

- You can use keyword arguments `make release version=0.1.2`

```makefile
.PHONY: release
release:
    @poetry run duty release version=$(version)
```

The final touch is to make this `help` target to be a default command:

```makefile
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help
```

And voila! Run `make` in your console and you will be amazed!

![Make in console](./make-console.png 'Output of default make command')

And in `README.md`?

```markdown
## How to run this project

Run `make` in your console for more detail.
```

## Conclusion

Using self-documented Makefile is a great answer to project management and stack orchestration. It will help you a lot
with running and maintaining your project from one place. And it will also help more to your teammates and junior or
incoming developers in your team to understand and start your project and sooner deliver some business value to it.
So take your time and prepare something like `make start` for them!
