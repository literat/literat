## Oh My ZSH

When you open iTerm2, you see that MacOS already comes with zsh as default shell.
Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for an improved (plugins, themes, ...) terminal (here: iTerm2) experience:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Update everything (e.g. plugins) in Oh My Zsh to recent version:

```bash
omz update
```

Important: If you change something in your Zsh configuration (.zshrc), force a reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Oh My Zsh Theme + Fonts:**

Install [powerline fonts](https://gist.github.com/shaykalyan/cd276a7d812dd393caf1).
As font we will be using Hack Nerd Font in iTerm2, VS Code, and Sublime Text. Install it via:

@TODO: installed by brewfile
```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

Use the new font in iTerm2: Preferences -> Profile -> Text -> Font: font-hack-nerd-font.

If the theme and font changes do not apply, reload your zsh configuration (.zshrc) or close/open iTerm2.

Install and configure [powerleven10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

```bash
p10k configure
```

Install and configure [Znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap)

Oh My Zsh Plugins

- brew
- cloudapp
- dotenv
- extract
- git
- macos
- brew
- composer
- docker
- gitfast
- git-extras
- jira
- node
- npm
- sublime
- symfony2
- tig
- yarn
- z
- ssh-agent

[ZSH Configuration File (.zshrc)](https://github.com/literat/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc)

## VS Code

The look and feel we want to achieve from our IDE:

![VS Code Look](./vscode.png 'VS Code Look')

Activate [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#:~:text=You%20can%20turn%20on%20Settings,and%20UI%20State%20are%20supported.)
with [VSCode Setting Gist](https://gist.github.com/literat/afcb5950f82a6ac8e3fc8199f6db504a)

[Extensions](https://github.com/literat/dotfiles/blob/master/vs-code-extensions-i-use.md)

## Git

From terminal, set global name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your-domain.com"
```

Improved git log:

```bash
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

Now use:

```bash
git lg
```

Set the default branch to main instead of master:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Print global git configuration:

```bash
git config --list
# or alias
# gitconfig
```

## SSH and GPG

There are two common strategies for SSH keys: one SSH key to rule them all or one SSH key per service.
I use the latter one and will here run yout through it by [connecting to GitHub via SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

With the 1password app this proccess is much straightforward.
Expecting that all keys are already in my account I only just need to setup the SSH agent.
This can be done in 1password with a few clicks.

Just follow the [docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/).

- Settings -> Developer -> Use the SSH agent

That's it.
1password have created an SSH key for you, even for one specific service, secured it via a passphrase,
made it automatically available for every terminal session, and applied it to GitHub.
In the case of GitHub, you are now able to interact with GitHub via SSH.

## NVM FOR NODE/NPM

The [node version manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is used to install and manage multiple Node versions.
After you have installed it via Homebrew in a previous step, type the following commands to complete the installation:

```bash
echo "source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

source ~/.zshrc
# or alias
# zshsource
```

Now install the latest LTS version on the command line:

```bash
nvm install <latest LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/>
```

Afterward, check whether the installation was successful and whether the [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) got installed along the way:

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

Update npm to its latest version:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

And set defaults for npm:

```bash
npm set init-author-name "your name"
npm set init-author-email "you@example.com"
npm set init-author-url "example.com"
```

If you are a library author, log in to npm too:

```bash
npm adduser
```

That's it. If you want to list all your Node.js installation, type the following:

```bash
nvm list
```

If you want to install a newer Node.js version, then type:

```bash
nvm install <version> --reinstall-packages-from=$(nvm current)
nvm use <version>
nvm alias default <version>
```

Optionally install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you use it as alternative to npm:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn -v
```

If you want to list all globally installed packages, run this command:

```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
```

That's it. You have a running version of Node.js and its package manager.

I hope my setup helps other developers to get their Mac up and running.
If you have any additional ideas or want to share your setup, let me know!
