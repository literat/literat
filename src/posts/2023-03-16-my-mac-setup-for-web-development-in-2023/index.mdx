## Oh My ZSH

When you open iTerm2, you see that MacOS already comes with zsh as default shell.
Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for an improved (plugins, themes, ...) terminal (here: iTerm2) experience:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Update everything (e.g. plugins) in Oh My Zsh to recent version:

```
omz update
```

Important: If you change something in your Zsh configuration (.zshrc), force a reload:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Oh My Zsh Theme + Fonts:**

Install [Agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) as your new terminal theme.
We will use Homebrew, but you can use an alternative from the website too:

```
brew install agnoster
```

Make it the default theme for Oh My ZSH from the terminal:

```
echo 'eval "$(agnoster init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Install [powerline fonts](https://gist.github.com/shaykalyan/cd276a7d812dd393caf1).
As font we will be using Hack Nerd Font in iTerm2, VS Code, and Sublime Text. Install it via:

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

Use the new font in iTerm2: Preferences -> Profile -> Text -> Font: font-hack-nerd-font.

If the theme and font changes do not apply, reload your zsh configuration (.zshrc) or close/open iTerm2.

Install and configure [powerleven10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

```
p10k configure
```

Install and configure [Znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap)

[ZSH Configuration File (.zshrc)](https://github.com/literat/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc)

## VS Code

The look and feel we want to achieve from our IDE:

![VS Code Look](./vscode.png 'VS Code Look')

Activate [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#:~:text=You%20can%20turn%20on%20Settings,and%20UI%20State%20are%20supported.)
with [VSCode Setting Gist](https://gist.github.com/literat/afcb5950f82a6ac8e3fc8199f6db504a)

[Extensions](https://github.com/literat/dotfiles/blob/master/vs-code-extensions-i-use.md)

## Git

From terminal, set global name and email:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your-domain.com"
```

Improved git log:

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

Now use:

```
git lg
```

Set the default branch to main instead of master:

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Print global git configuration:

```
git config --list
# or alias
# gitconfig
```

Setup GPG commit verification

```
# https://gist.github.com/oseme-techguy/bae2e309c084d93b75a9b25f49718f85
# To fix the " gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/home/path/to/user/.gnupg' " error
# Make sure that the .gnupg directory and its contents is accessibile by your user.
chown -R $(whoami) ~/.gnupg/

# Also correct the permissions and access rights on the directory
chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/*
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg

# Originaly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494631/gpg-failed-to-sign-the-data-fatal-failed-to-write-commit-object-git-2-10-0

brew upgrade gnupg  # This has a make step which takes a while
brew link --overwrite gnupg
brew install pinentry-mac
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
killall gpg-agent

echo "test" | gpg --clearsign  # on linux it's gpg2 but brew stays as gpg

git config --global gpg.program gpg  # perhaps you had this already? On linux maybe gpg2
git config --global commit.gpgsign true  # if you want to sign every commit

git commit -S -m ""

git log --show-signature -1
```

Export public GPG key

```
gpg --output public.pgp --armor --export username@email
```

## SSH

There are two common strategies for SSH keys: one SSH key to rule them all or one SSH key per service.
I use the latter one and will here run yout through it by [connecting to GitHub via SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

First, create a new SSH key in the ~/.ssh folder:

### in case the folder is not there yet

```
mkdir ~/.ssh

cd ~/.ssh
# or alias
# sshhome

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github"
# follow instructions
# use file name: github
# use passphrase and store it somewhere secure
```

Confirm whether passphrase was used properly by accessing private key:

```
ssh-keygen -y -f gitHub
# confirm with passphrase
```

Create the SSH configuration file if it doesn't exist yet:

```
# in case the file is not there yet
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

In your _~/.ssh/config_ file, add the new SSH key, so that it can get picked up for every terminal session automatically:

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github
```

Add SSH key to MacOS' keychain:

```
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/github
```

Add the public key to your GitHub settings via the website or via the GitHub CLI (via brew install gh):

```
# copy public key and add it to https://github.com/
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

# or use GitHub's CLI
gh auth login
# for the first login I think the SSH key gets added
```

### without the next command, but if not:

```
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -t github
```

That's it.
You have created an SSH key locally for one specific service, secured it via a passphrase,
made it automatically available for every terminal session, and applied it to GitHub.
In the case of GitHub, you are now able to interact with GitHub via SSH.

## NVM FOR NODE/NPM

The [node version manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is used to install and manage multiple Node versions.
After you have installed it via Homebrew in a previous step, type the following commands to complete the installation:

```
echo "source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

source ~/.zshrc
# or alias
# zshsource
```

Now install the latest LTS version on the command line:

```
nvm install <latest LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/>
```

Afterward, check whether the installation was successful and whether the [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) got installed along the way:

```
node -v && npm -v
```

Update npm to its latest version:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

And set defaults for npm:

```
npm set init.author.name "your name"
npm set init.author.email "you@example.com"
npm set init.author.url "example.com"
```

If you are a library author, log in to npm too:

```
npm adduser
```

That's it. If you want to list all your Node.js installation, type the following:

```
nvm list
```

If you want to install a newer Node.js version, then type:

```
nvm install <version> --reinstall-packages-from=$(nvm current)
nvm use <version>
nvm alias default <version>
```

Optionally install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you use it as alternative to npm:

```
npm install -g yarn
yarn -v
```

If you want to list all globally installed packages, run this command:

```
npm list -g --depth=0
```

That's it. You have a running version of Node.js and its package manager.

I hope my setup helps other developers to get their Mac up and running.
If you have any additional ideas or want to share your setup, let me know!
