If you are using a handy CLI utility for running multiple npm scripts like me,
you are probably using [npm-run-all][npm-run-all]. This library is highly
popular with almost 3 million weekly downloads. But there is a little problem
with this library. It has not been maintained for almost 5 years. And this
should be a problem for this kind of heavily popular library...

However, this chapter has a happy ending. For now. There is a fork of the
original library called [npm-run-all2][npm-run-all2]. Beware, this is the
maintenance fork with some automated updates enabled. Some other burden is being
removed and maybe the new maintainers will push the library much further.

Wish luck and switch your dependency to the maintained one.
