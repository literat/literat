Every codebase should be readable. And when the codebase  grows bigger and bigger, what was at the beginning recommendation, becomes a necessity.
One of the tools that helps us to keep our code clean and readable is ESLint. After a years of maintaining complex codebases, the ESLint and code linting as general,
becomes a natural part of frontend developer's workflow.

With the new release of ESLint v9 and with the introduction of flat configuration system, it comes the time to upgrade.

In this post I would like to share my experience with the migration and go through the steps that I have taken to make the migration as smooth as possible.

> Note: If you are starting with the fresh project, I suggest checking out the official [ESLint Quick Start Guide][eslint-quick-start].

Ok, let's dive into the good, bad and annoying parts of the migration process to ESLint v9.

## News in ESLint v9

TODO: some intro about ESLint and the struggle

TODO: What is new in ESLint v9 and why to migrate

Flat configuration

add some info about why everyone is moving to *.config.js

  1:1  error  Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression  no-unused-expressions
Eslint with flat cannot lint JSON, the approach has changed, use eslint plugin jsonc

TODO: starting with migration

- eslint v8 supports flat config, so do the compatibility migration first
- use migration tool
- fix plugins and configs
- ignore files
- fix errors

import { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'; // not in Eslint v8

Multiple extends in underlying configs are not being resolved correctly

use `--debug` parameter

use ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false for partial migration

TODO: bump to the Eslint v9
- go plugin by plugin

Some notes

- the order of adding other objects matters
  - it is just JS object so the last attribute wins/overrides the previous ones

- beware of Node API like `__dirname` use import.url instead
- FlatCompat should be used only for legacy configs
- base dir is not necessary to set
- defineConfig only adds another layer of abstraction, it is not necessary -
  typings, IMHO
- extends attribute is not supported
