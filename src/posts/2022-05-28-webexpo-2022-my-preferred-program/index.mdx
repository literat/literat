[WebExpo 2022 conference in Prague](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022) is just around the corner. 10. - 12. June 2022 is approaching and I am looking forward to it.

This year will be a little bit different because of cooperation with the Frontendisti group. On Saturday the entire stage will be only for
frontend topics. You can read more about it from [Martin Michálek on Vzhurudolu.cz](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz)
and [his selection of talks](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/blog/214-webexpo-2022).

After success with the [First Czech Frontend conference in 2021](https://frontendisti.cz/konference), this is the second time the Frontendisti
introduces itself on this scale.

I hope that I will enjoy this year as much as I do the last one. Let's continue with my program selections…

## Friday schedule

- [Runa Sandvik](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/designing-technology-that-enables-free-speech)
  will talk about technologies supporting free speech.
  This is so actual nowadays. I think I want to hear that, especially after the shutdown of disinformation websites in the Czech republic.
- [Prabashwara Seneviratne](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/building-pc-game-uis-with-html)
  has talk about using HTML and other web technologies to build games. Maybe you know World of Tanks.
- [Jan Toman](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/data-informed-design-systems)
  is our consultant at LMC for the design systems. This is a must-have since we are also building one.
- [Michal Sänger](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/graphql-at-scale)
  and **Graphql at Scale** sound very interesting to me. I love this technology.
- [Alexey Sharov](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/simple-machine-learning-for-web-developers-from-theory-to-practice)
  and his Simple Machine Learning for Web Developers sounds also very interesting.
  Because I am hearing about machine learning from all around. But everybody is talking about AI. So I need to hear more.
- [Honza Mayer](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/jan-mayer) and **#CultureClash** in his company.
  This should be fun. Because he hired a global developer star and was very surprised by what happened.

### Roundtable discussions are better than ever

I was pleasantly surprised by the topics of the roundtable discussions.

- [Robert Jiřík](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/roundtable-discussion): **In the times of Agile, is project management dead?**
  This should be an interesting discussion about project management in an agile team.
  Is it project manager still needed if the team is well-organized and self-driven?
- [Pavel Kalandra](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/roundtable-discussion-2): **How to find time for technical improvements**
  Adding more new features to the product. Technical debt is growing. How to keep up with technical upgrades and improvements?
  This is a topic with which we are also struggling and do not know how to face.

### What to do on WebExpo next

![Play with Ozobots](./IMG_20210921_115046.jpg 'Playing with Ozobots')

Kids are welcome at this venue. Last year I and my son enjoyed building and playing with lego robots and ozobots.
This time I will be babysitting all of my three children. So it will be much more fun. Check out [the workshops for kids](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/workshop-for-kids-lounge-area-for-parents-with-babies).

Also do not miss Friday and Saturday [parties](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/venue) ;-)
