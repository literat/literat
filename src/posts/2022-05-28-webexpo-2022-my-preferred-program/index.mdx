[WebExpo 2022 conference in Prague](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022) is just
around the corner. 10. - 12. June 2022 is approaching and I am looking forward
to it.

This year will be a little bit different because of cooperation with the
Frontendisti group. On Saturday the entire stage will be only for frontend
topics. You can read more about it from
[Martin Michálek on Vzhurudolu.cz](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz) and
[his selection of talks](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/blog/214-webexpo-2022).

After success with the
[First Czech Frontend conference in 2021](https://frontendisti.cz/konference),
this is the second time the Frontendisti introduces itself on this scale.

I hope that I will enjoy this year as much as I do the last one. Let's continue
with my program selections…

## Friday schedule

- [Runa Sandvik](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/designing-technology-that-enables-free-speech)
  will talk about technologies supporting free speech. This is so actual
  nowadays. I think I want to hear that, especially after the shutdown of
  disinformation websites in the Czech republic.
- [Prabashwara Seneviratne](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/building-pc-game-uis-with-html)
  has talk about using HTML and other web technologies to build games. Maybe you
  know World of Tanks.
- [Jan Toman](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/data-informed-design-systems)
  is our consultant at LMC for the design systems. This is a must-have since we
  are also building one.
- [Michal Sänger](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/graphql-at-scale) and
  **Graphql at Scale** sound very interesting to me. I love this technology.
- [Alexey Sharov](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/simple-machine-learning-for-web-developers-from-theory-to-practice)
  and his Simple Machine Learning for Web Developers sounds also very
  interesting. Because I am hearing about machine learning from all around. But
  everybody is talking about AI. So I need to hear more.
- [Honza Mayer](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/jan-mayer) and
  **#CultureClash** in his company. This should be fun. Because he hired a
  global developer star and was very surprised by what happened.

### Roundtable discussions are better than ever

I was pleasantly surprised by the topics of the roundtable discussions.

- [Robert Jiřík](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/roundtable-discussion):
  **In the times of Agile, is project management dead?** This should be an
  interesting discussion about project management in an agile team. Is it
  project manager still needed if the team is well-organized and self-driven?
- [Pavel Kalandra](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/roundtable-discussion-2):
  **How to find time for technical improvements** Adding more new features to
  the product. Technical debt is growing. How to keep up with technical upgrades
  and improvements? This is a topic with which we are also struggling and do not
  know how to face.

### What to do on WebExpo next

![Play with Ozobots](./IMG_20210921_115046.jpg 'Playing with Ozobots')

Kids are welcome at this venue. Last year I and my son enjoyed building and
playing with lego robots and ozobots. This time I will be babysitting all of my
three children. So it will be much more fun. Check out
[the workshops for kids](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/talk/workshop-for-kids-lounge-area-for-parents-with-babies).

Also do not miss Friday and Saturday
[parties](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2022/venue) ;-)
