      Hello! I get lots of email, so please scan this page before firing one
      off. Don't be afraid to email me, it just might take a few days (or weeks)
      for me to get back to you ðŸ˜ƒ.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you want me to work for you</strong>, I am open to new
      opportunities and your offer. But, please, check out my{' '}
      <LinkedInProfileLink /> first. If I am right guy for your job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        If you want to know what font, theme, computer or toilet paper I use
      </strong>
      , all that info is available on my <a href="/uses">/uses</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you are a recruiter</strong>, I love you, but please donâ€™t call
      me ðŸ™‚. Rather check out my <LinkedInProfileLink /> first and then email me
      particular offer. I'm also not able to help you find someone for your
      position.
